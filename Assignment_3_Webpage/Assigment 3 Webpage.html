        <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
        <p>This report reflects upon assignment 1 task topic, the emergence of cloud gaming and its impact on game development, which explored software and hardware shifts, and high-end content. These topics covered the potential effect it has on technological systems and the way it will influence the demands of consumers. This then determines the path of game developers and how they must customise and shape systems to cater towards their audiences. High quality content is not only visually appealing but brings users and immersive experience. Going hand in hand, software and hardware shifts determine the output of quality and in turn influence the response to user’s experience. Traditional methods of teaching have slowly changed by adapting to the introduction of built in smart boards, the normalised use of laptops assigned to students, and the growth of learning accompanied by these machineries. Cloud gaming has “revolutionised the field of networks and the way of utilising the resources remotely” (Krishna et al., 2017). This document will critique and analyse several credible state-of-the-art literatures, review popular applications regarding cloud gaming and how it has become, and will become, a solution for educational purposes. The use of game-related activities has shown to impact children, based on studies, revealed noticeable learning improvement (Chaarani et al., 2022). Traditional teaching methods may be affected in various ways from improving classroom engagement to fostering critical thinking skills. There issues that may impede on the utilization of cloud technology such as technical and quality limitations. Regarding Australian schools, they differ from the rest of the world as schools are “funded through a combination of Australian Government (Commonwealth) funding” (The Department of Education, n.d.). The forthcoming discussion will draw upon previous ideas to explore challenges and prospects of integrating cloud gaming in the future of education.  </p>

        <h3>Introduction</h3>

        <p>The internet boom has given access to knowledge, stories, and products globally that would not have been accessible without the devices and systems which enable a channel of information. Online users have access to over thousands of games in libraries without the concern for memory storage and hardware requirements. This not only cost effective for consumers, but for game companies. A couple of notable game companies who have implemented cloud gaming systems include Playstation, Xbox and Tencent. The utilisation of could systems for games has become a growing development since its first occurrence with software firm, G-cluster, who “developed a successful cloud gaming business model” over ten years (Ojala et al., 2011). With the implementation of such devices and tools within classrooms, educators can bring an impactful learning experience to students who are raised side by side and influenced by these technologies. Imagine a society where a standardised education can be utilised and shared across the networks and globally through the cloud. Mirko Sužnjević, associate professor, Department of Telecommunications states, “Using games in schools is one of the innovative services that can drive motivation of students for better participation” (Sužnjević, et al., 2020). This change is carried by the industrial developments which effect all industries and will continue to do so in the future. The effectiveness of cloud gaming in education, the impact of traditional teaching methods, and accessibility and equity are topics which are explored to determine whether cloud gaming can pose as a solution for education.</p>

        <h3>Effectiveness of cloud gaming in education</h3>

        <p>In recent years, games have developed in many ways through improved graphics and realistic visuals, light and textures. This enhancement of user experience has been expressed in various game types such as first-person-shooter (FPS), role playing games (RPG) and strategy games. For instance, the very popular, The Elder Scrolls and Mass Effect franchises are most notable for their story-rich game play which delves into fictional world building and multidimensional characters. These features capture audiences as a form of entertainment and attachment, enhancing gameplay (Armbrust, M. 2018). Maintaining the attention of users, children for instance, is not a difficult task when parents struggle to remove them from their devices. The integration of gaming in education can suggest a potential method to improve the effectiveness of learning for students. For instance, a popular game like Maths Blaster from Vivendi Universal has proven to be effective in the retention of attention in education (Pivec et al., 2007).</p>
