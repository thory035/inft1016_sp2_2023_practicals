# Assignemnt 3 Webpage

This website is titled "The Emergence of Cloud Games and the Impact of Game Development" in both the tab title and as the main heading.

To demonstrate an understanding of the previous practicals, the buttons have been coded to display a seleciton of example images. When the user selects a button, the corresponding image and paragraph will change. The link within the paragraph has also been hyperlinked to the source image website.

The content contains various heading types and paragraphs containing content from Assignment 2 based on the template provided. A dynamic heading box implements the input into the heading once the user selects submit. The toggle theme located below the header changes to the following:

```
heading-color: 
bg-color:
font-color:
font-color-dark: 
```
local.storage was coded to ensure the user perference of the toggle theme was enabled on the website even after the page was refreshed. Adjacent to the "Toggle Theme" button, the time and date stamp can be found.
